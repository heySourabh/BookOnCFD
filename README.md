> The journey of a book on programming computational fluid dynamics software as it evolves

The book being written will focus on good programming practices to be considered while writing a computational fluid dynamics software. This being a book, we will start by looking at the basic aspects of CFD and its applications. Then, we will dive into the basic structure of a CFD code and propose an algorithm. The algorithm will be modeled in an abstract sense into a code. As an how different aspects of the CFD are written in the book, they will reflect in the code as well.

The book will be restricted to hyperbolic partial differential equations. However, elliptic PDEs can be solved using the same code by introducing a pseudo time for evolution.

The book is written using markdown syntax, as it provides all the required features for writing a well formatted book. It can be easily viewed within GitHub's viewer.

I wish that you have a lot of fun reading this book and using the code examples and experimenting with them.
