While typing the chapter "Introduction to CFD" I realized that LaTeX equations
are not supported by markdown on GitHub.

The base copy of the book is therefore, moved from markdown to LaTeX.
However, since it is easy to read and copy markdown, I will maintain a 
markdown copy synced with the LaTeX copy. The math will be rendered using
images in markdown (so will not look pretty).
